## 🛠️ Task Breakdown

### Step 1 — Define Core KPIs
Formally define 3–5 Key Performance Indicators with formulas and business rationale.

| KPI | Formula | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Total Sales | `SUM(Sales)` | Overall revenue |
| Total Profit | `SUM(Profit)` | Net earnings |
| Profit Margin % | `Profit / Sales × 100` | Pricing efficiency |
| Average Order Value | `Total Sales / Total Orders` | Revenue per order |
| Total Orders | `DISTINCTCOUNT(Order ID)` | Order volume |

### Step 2 — Deep-Dive Analysis
Selected focus areas for deep-dive investigation:

- **Segmentation Analysis** — Business-rule-based customer segmentation (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)
- **Discount Impact Analysis** — Identifying the profit-break threshold across categories and regions
- **Category Profitability** — Sub-category level margin decomposition

### Step 3 — Interactive Dashboard Build
Built a fully functional, multi-page Power BI dashboard surfacing core KPIs and enabling exploratory drill-down.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Category Performance
- **Technology** → Highest profit margin (~17%) — best performing category
- **Furniture** → Lowest margin (~2.5%) — Tables & Bookcases generate losses
- **Office Supplies** → High volume, moderate profit

### Regional Performance
- **West** → Top region for sales and profit
- **Central** → Weakest region due to heavy discounting

### Customer Segments
- **Consumer** → 51% of orders; highest discounts compress margins
- **Corporate** → Higher order value and better profit margins

### Discount Impact
- Discounts above **30%** consistently result in **negative profit**
- Furniture receives the highest average discounts (25–30%)
